## Examples

Manual server count post every 30 minutes:
```py
from discord.ext import tasks

import dbl

# This example uses tasks provided by discord.ext to create a task that posts guild count to top.gg every 30 minutes.

dbl_token = 'top.gg token'  # set this to your bot's top.gg token
bot.dblpy = dbl.DBLClient(bot, dbl_token)

@tasks.loop(minutes=30)
async def update_stats():
    """This function runs every 30 minutes to automatically update your server count."""
    try:
        await bot.dblpy.post_guild_count()
        print(f'Posted server count ({bot.dblpy.guild_count})')
    except Exception as e:
        print('Failed to post server count\n{}: {}'.format(type(e).__name__, e))

update_stats.start()
```

Webhook
```py
import dbl

# This example uses dblpy's webhook system.
# In order to run the webhook, at least webhook_port argument must be specified (number between 1024 and 49151).

dbl_token = 'top.gg token'  # set this to your bot's top.gg token
bot.dblpy = dbl.DBLClient(bot, dbl_token, webhook_path='/dblwebhook', webhook_auth='password', webhook_port=5000)

@bot.event
async def on_dbl_vote(data):
    """An event that is called whenever someone votes for the bot on top.gg."""
    print(f"Received an upvote:\n{data}")

@bot.event
async def on_dbl_test(data):
    """An event that is called whenever someone tests the webhook system for your bot on top.gg."""
    print(f"Received a test upvote:\n{data}")
```

Automatically post server count every 30 minutes
```py
import dbl

# This example uses dblpy's autopost feature to post guild count to top.gg every 30 minutes.

dbl_token = 'top.gg token'  # set this to your bot's top.gg token
bot.dblpy = dbl.DBLClient(bot, dbl_token, autopost=True)

@bot.event
async def on_guild_post():
    """An event that is called whenever autopost successfully posts server count."""
    print(f'Posted server count ({bot.dblpy.guild_count})')
```
