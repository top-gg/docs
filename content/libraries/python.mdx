## Examples

Manual server count post every 30 minutes:

```py
from discord.ext import tasks

import topgg

# This example uses tasks provided by discord.ext to create a task that posts guild count to Top.gg every 30 minutes.

dbl_token = "Top.gg token"  # set this to your bot's Top.gg token
bot.topggpy = topgg.DBLClient(bot, dbl_token)


@tasks.loop(minutes=30)
async def update_stats():
    """This function runs every 30 minutes to automatically update your server count."""
    try:
        await bot.topggpy.post_guild_count()
        print(f"Posted server count ({bot.topggpy.guild_count})")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to post server count\n{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}")


update_stats.start()
```

Webhook:

```py
import topgg

# This example uses topggpy's webhook system.
bot.topgg_webhook = topgg.WebhookManager(bot).dbl_webhook("/dblwebhook", "password")

# The port must be a number between 1024 and 49151.
bot.topgg_webhook.run(5000)  # this method can be awaited as well


@bot.event
async def on_dbl_vote(data):
    """An event that is called whenever someone votes for the bot on Top.gg."""
    if data["type"] == "test":
        # this is roughly equivalent to
        # `return await on_dbl_test(data)` in this case
        return bot.dispatch("dbl_test", data)

    print(f"Received a vote:\n{data}")


@bot.event
async def on_dbl_test(data):
    """An event that is called whenever someone tests the webhook system for your bot on Top.gg."""
    print(f"Received a test vote:\n{data}")
```

Automatically post server count every 30 minutes:

```py
import topgg

# This example uses topggpy's autopost feature to post guild count to Top.gg every 30 minutes
# as well as the shard count if applicable.

dbl_token = "Top.gg token"  # set this to your bot's Top.gg token
bot.topggpy = topgg.DBLClient(bot, dbl_token, autopost=True, post_shard_count=True)


@bot.event
async def on_autopost_success():
    print(
        f"Posted server count ({bot.topggpy.guild_count}), shard count ({bot.shard_count})"
    )
```
