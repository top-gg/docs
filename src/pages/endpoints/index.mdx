# Getting Started

Our API is HTTPS/REST for general operations such as sending **`POST`** requests and receiving **`GET`** requests. {{ className: "lead" }}

## Base URL

## Authentication
To access our API you need to authorize yourself, this can be done by using your Top.gg auth token. Your token can be obtained from your bot page settings under Webhooks (https://top.gg/bot/BOTID/webhooks replacing **`BOTID`** with the ID of your bot). {{ className: "lead" }}

Authentication is performed with the **`Authorization`** HTTP header.
