# PHP Library

The community-maintained PHP library for Top.gg. If you experience any issues, please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/top-gg/php-sdk). {{ className: "lead" }}

## Installation

### Composer (recommended)

```
composer require top-gg/php-sdk
```

## Usage
This library does certain things differently from other API wrappers because it follows PHP's PSR standards. {{ className: "lead" }}
Below is sample code on how to initialize and use the API wrapper. {{ className: "lead" }}

```php
# Automatically load up the source library code.
include_once __DIR__ . "vendor/autoload.php";

use DBL\DBL;

$api = new DBL([
      "token" => "YOUR TOP.GG API TOKEN HERE."
]);
```

Below are the currently accepted list of parameters when initializing the API. {{ className: "lead" }}

| Option       | Type      | Description                      | Optional? |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------- | --------- |
| `token`      | `string`  | The token key of the Top.gg API. | No        |
| `auto_stats` | `array[]` | Details for automatic stats.     | Yes       |
| `safety`     | `bool`    | Webserver code protection.       | Yes       |

The API wrapper also presents you with a boolean instance, `connected` which may be used to check if your API token key is still valid or not. {{ className: "lead" }}

### Get statistics from Top.gg

In order to get statistics about a bot or user from Top.gg, you are able to select between the two interchangably with the same method: `find_info()`. {{ className: "lead" }}

```php
public function find_info(string $type, int $id): array
```

| Argument | Type     | Description                               |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `$type`  | `string` | Whether you're looking for a bot or user. |
| `$id`    | `int`    | The bot/user ID.                          |

```php
use DBL\API\Http;

if($api->connected)
{
  /**
    * You will always be presented two constants to choose.
    *
    * Http::BOT = "bots"
    * Http::USER = "users"
    */
  $user = $api->find_info(Http::USER, 242351388137488384);
  $bot = $api->find_info(Http::BOT, 799697654279307314);

  print_r($user) . print_r($bot) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

### Search for specific bots

Similar to the same premise as using `find_info()`, you are able to additionally plug in query information that will be automatically formatted as a query-string URL search when an HTTP request is made by the API wrapper for you. This is known as `show_info()`. {{ className: "lead" }}

```php
public function show_info(string $type, array $json = []): array
```

| Argument | Type     | Description                               |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `$type`  | `string` | Whether you're looking for a bot or user. |
| `$json`  | `array`  | Information to plug into the search.      |

```php
use DBL\API\Http;

if($api->connected)
{
      $small_list = $api->show_info(
            Http::BOT,
            [
                  "limit" => 20,
                  "sort" => "-"
            ]
      );

      print_r($small_list) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

### Checking a vote from a user

It's very important to be able and see if a user has voted for your bot - below is the given example of how to do this. {{ className: "lead" }}

```php
public function get_user_vote(int $id, int $user): array
```

| Argument | Type  | Description              |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| `$id`    | `int` | The bot ID.              |
| `$user`  | `int` | The user's snowflake ID. |

```php
if($api->connected)
{
      $isVoted = $api->get_user_vote(799697654279307314, 242351388137488384);
      if($isVoted) echo "This user voted!";
}
```
