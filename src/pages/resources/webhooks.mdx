# Webhooks

Instead of requesting our API to see the users who have voted for your bot, you can now use webhooks! Webhooks will send a `POST` request to a URL of your choice when your bot has been voted for. {{ className: "lead" }}

## Getting Started

Start by setting up your webhook URL in the edit form of your bot on this site, it can be found at https://top.gg/bot/YOUR_BOT_ID/webhooks (Replace `YOUR_BOT_ID` with your bot's ID!). Once you've entered the URL you want the webhook to be sent to, you're all set! If you need help setting up webhooks, don't be afraid to ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dbl) in the [`#topgg-api`](https://discord.com/channels/264445053596991498/412006692125933568) channel. {{ className: "lead" }}


## Security

On the edit page you can see another input for `Authorization`. Here you can provide a shared secret that you can check for on the server side. {{ className: "lead" }}

To verify requests are coming from us, look for the value in the `Authorization` header and make sure it is the same as the value you provided in the form. {{ className: "lead" }}

If you're running a firewall, you can whitelist the following IPs, which will be used to deliver webhooks for the foreseeable future: {{ className: "lead" }}

**`159.203.105.187`** {{ className: "lead -mt-6" }}



## Acknowledgement

Webhooks sent by Top.gg must be acknowledged with a **`200`** response within **5 seconds** in order to be considered successful. Unsuccessful webhooks will be queued and retried up to 10 times (Dependant on the response's status code). The retry delay is increased exponentially per retry by `2^N` seconds, from a minimum delay of 1 second for the first retry up to 17 minutes for the tenth. Errors resulting with status **`4XX`** (like 404) will not be retried as these are considered user errors. {{ className: "lead" }}

Top.gg libraries that handle webhooks acknowledge webhooks automatically. {{ className: "lead" }}
