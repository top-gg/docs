Our API is HTTPS/REST for general operations such as sending `POST` requests and receiving `GET` requests.

#### Base Url

[https://top.gg/api](https://top.gg/api)

## Authentication

To access our API you need to authorize yourself, this can be done by using your discord bot list token. Your token can be obtained from your bot page settings under **Webhooks** (https://top.gg/bot/:yourbotid/webhooks replacing `:yourbotid` with the ID of your bot).

Authentication is performed with the `Authorization` HTTP header as such

```json:title=HTTP%20Headers
{
  "Authorization": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6Ijk5OTg0Nzg1MDc0Nzg5OTkxNCIsImJvdCI6dHJ1ZSwiaWF0IjoxNjYwNTQ1NTI5fQ.OG7MMqmgcUtFmRjdKplwlrxMECTILkSS6e3iYNwr8YU"
