## 🔗 Overview

Top.gg's API is a standard **RESTful** interface using **HTTPS**.  
You interact with it via common HTTP verbs like:

- `GET` to retrieve data
- `POST` to submit or update data

---

## 🌐 Base URL

All requests are made to:

```
https://top.gg/api
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication

To access the API, you must authenticate with your **bot's API token**.

> You can find your token under your bot's page:  
> `https://top.gg/bot/:yourbotid/webhooks`  
> *(replace `:yourbotid` with your actual bot ID)*

Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```json title="HTTP Headers"
{
  "Authorization": "your-topgg-token-here"
}
```
