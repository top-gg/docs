## Project Platform

A Platform is used to identify where the corresponding ID links towards.

### Allowed Values

`discord`, `roblox`

## Project Type

The type of a project helps top.gg synchronize features. For example, a discord bot may have a support server, but this would not make any sense for a discord server. You can use this to further find out the specificity of the project. 

### Allowed Values

`bot`, `server`, `game`

### Vote
